EmberConf 2015
==============

[Leah Silber](https://twitter.com/wifelette) and [Kait Olson](https://twitter.com/@tildekait) and the volunteers did an incredible job again this year of putting together this conference. Learn how Leah creates memorable conferences in her book: [Event Driven](https://leanpub.com/eventdriven/).

Summary
-------

The themes of the Ember community are productivity and friendliness. As mentioned by Chris Eppstein in the closing talk, those two goals may often be at odds, especially considering how the drive to compete is most often tightly bound with adversarial behavior. So far though, Ember developers demonstrate strong commitment to both advancing frontend web development as well as curating healthy community.

### Health
  * There were 625 attendees of the conference and it sold out quickly.
  *  Only 13 no-shows on the first day!
  * [Ember Community Survey results](http://201-created.com/ember-community-survey-2015)

### Themes
  * Design and user experience.
  * Performance.

### Companies
  * Good representation from large to small organizations.

### Projects targeting beta release on June 12, 2015
  1. Ember 2.0
  2. Ember Inspector 1.0

### Ember.js Performance

Stefan Penner | [@stefanpenner](http://twitter.com/@stefanpenner) | [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com) | [Slides (_Coming soon…_)]() | [Video (_Coming soon…_)]()

* Promises performance improvements
  * Look inside the black box of browser performance
  * Bluebird library
    * Align with language primitives
* Idempotent rerender branch
* JS performance cargo-cult problem
  * Better question: When is X slow? When is X reasonable?
  * Shapes
* “Mechanical sympathy” from F1 driver
  * Look inside browser runtime implementations such as V8.
  * Code that is understandable and predictable (from both human and computer POV) is fast.
* Misalignments in Ember
  * Do less work
    * Explicit data-flow: Actions up, bindings down
    * Explicit life-cycle: RIP Singleton Controllers
  * init/super
    * Problems
      * Hard to learn
      * Misaligned with ES2015
    * Solution
      * Implicit defaults in init
      * Pass args
  * Ember.Object.reopen
    * Problems
      * Buggy
      * Complex
      * Meta is live inheriting
      * actionsFor from Meta.listeners
    * Solution
      * Working on a spike for this to reform Ember.Object.reopen

### Designing for Ember Apps

Steve Trevathan | [@strevat](http://twitter.com/@strevat) | [Dockyard](http://dockyard.com) | [Slides (_Coming soon…_)]() | [Video (_Coming soon…_)]()

* Designing single page apps.
* Users are difficult.
* Mental models.
  * Familiarity
  * Assumptions
  * Can be updated.
* What is “home”?
  * Valuing of thing is based on previous experience.
* Macro: What is it for?
* Micro: How does it work?
* Use patterns explicitly if they directly apply.
* Methods and patterns:
  1. Gradual engagement - Get started and recognize value with minimal effort
  1. Skeleton UI - Thinning out the spinners and replace with placeholder images, controls, and animation
  1. …don't leave me hanging - Handoffs. Contextually aware UI such as Rdio and Spotify knowing which device music is playing from.
  1. Core Interactions - Become a symbol of your app (product).
  1. Offline Mode - “Goliath Mode”. Respond optimistically, but be careful.

### The Art of Ember Deployment

Luke Melia | [@lukemelia](http://twitter.com/@lukemelia) | [Yapp](https://www.yapp.us) | [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lukemelia/the-art-of-ember-app-deployment)

“The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed.” -William Gibson

* Current server app deployment model is not appropriate for Ember apps.
* How to keep static assets working during the switchover?
  * Push all static assets to a CDN and keep them around.
  * Long lived sessions?
    * We have multiple versions of our Ember apps in use at once.
* Learn from native mobile apps.
* Key differences:
  * HTML pages bootstrap Ember apps
    * Points to fingerprinted assets, but is not itself fingerprinted.
    * …
* Use Redis (low latency store) to deploy index.html to app server.
  * Allows
    * Preview before activating.
    * Dynamic HTML rewriting between Redis and app server.
      * Feature flags
      * CSRF tokens
    * A/B testing
    * Notify clients of new version availability
* Which approach from the projects that currently do this?
  * ember-deploy, front-end-builds, ember-cli-deploy
  * Merge all 3! -> ember-cli-deploy
  * Great example of community desire to coalesce
* Timeline
  * 0.4.0 This week
  * 0.5.0 Soon

### Test-Driven Development by Example

Toran Billups | [@toranb](http://twitter.com/@toranb) | [toranbillups.com](http://toranbillups.com) | [Video (_Coming soon…_)]()

* Live coding like no one is watching.

  * Enduring
  * Participants win
2. Transpilers are here to stay
  * Remy Sharp coined “Polyfill”
  * For stuff that can't be polyfilled, must transpile.
  * Babel (Previously 6to5)
3. Aligning Ember's object model
* ES Classes
  * `class`
